# Background

I used to love Blueprint, and it still holds a special place in my heart.
It was the first true programming language that I learned, and it was the gateway drug for me to get into C# with Unity,
which is still my most favorite programming language.

However, as I have grown as a developer and have branched out deeper into game and even web development, I come
back to Blueprint with mixed emotions.
While Blueprint is highly accessible, it also holds the engine itself back in several ways.

The lack of proper generics/templates in Blueprint holds Unreal Engine itself back.
For example, it is not possible to have multidimensional `TArray`s, `TMap`s, or `TSet`s.
As such, it isn't possible to create a `TArray<TArray<int32>>` in C++ like you can in basically any other language,
including in C++ itself where you can make a `std::vector<std::vector<int32>>`.
If you want to be able to work with generic types with proper engine support (reflection, garbage collection),
you need to either use a custom K2_Node (extremely tedious) or a Blueprint Macro (which has several limitations
of its own).

Another big language limitation is the lack of first-class functions within Blueprint, so no lambda support, no
closures, no anonymous functions, etc.
Again, to get an equivalent experience, you must work with either Blueprint Macros or make a custom K2_Node.
Because of this, to have proper engine support in C++, you need to work with function pointers on UObject
types, which is not ergonomic.
Blueprint Macros are pretty reasonable to create, but needing to make a K2_Node takes substantially more effort.

Both of these limitations became extremely clear whenever working on an adaptation for ReactiveX for Blueprint.
Getting it to work in C++ land was straightforward enough; I was able to just add ReactivePlusPlus, and it worked fine.
But, trying to get it to also work with Blueprint was a much greater feat; I ended up making a separate library
specifically for Blueprint that went all-in on Blueprint Macros.

The biggest problem that I face with using Blueprint nowadays is that the actual developer experience is extremely poor,
especially as a person who primarily uses laptops and oftentimes is away from a mouse.

I have an Asus ProArt P16 with a high-resolution touchscreen.
You might think that using a touchscreen would be great for Blueprints because of how graphical it is.
In reality, it's the exact opposite. Using a touchscreen with Blueprint is practically unusable.
Whenever you drag on an empty space, it doesn't drag the graph around; it creates a highlight box.
You can't pull any pins off of nodes. You can't even drag any nodes around. Clicking on anything on the screen rarely
registers as a proper click, especially with dropdowns.
I imagine that using Blueprint is far better whenever using a drawing tablet because it typically maps to mouse
movements, and tapping the pen usually maps to a left-mouse click.
Tapping a touchscreen does NOT map to a left-mouse click; it maps to a touch, which Unreal Engine hardly supports.

Furthermore, the Asus ProArt P16 has a giant trackpad. Whenever I try panning with a trackpad, it just zooms in and out
because it registers it as scrolling vertically and horizontally.
The only way to pan with a trackpad is by holding down the right click with one of my fingers and then using another
finger to drag.

Fortunately, the Blueprint Assist plugin helps with a large amount of that.
Trying to do any programming with Blueprint is actually doable with the help of Blueprint Assist, but it's still not
as good as using a mouse.

So while Blueprint presents itself as a way for designers to be able to do a bit of programming, it doesn't support
input methods that designers would be more likely to use.

Another big issue with using Blueprint is the system resource usage while just programming (not even testing anything).
Unreal Engine's UI, including Blueprint, is built using Unreal Engine itself wth a combination of Slate and UMG.
This is usually a good thing for a variety of reasons; dogfooding means that Epic Games is able to work through issues
that they themselves face during the development of the engine.
That also means that you have a lot of source-available examples to look through on how to use Slate and UMG to
implement some very complex UI.
However, Unreal Engine is a AAA game engine first-and-foremost, so its UI is catered for people on high-power machines,
the same kinds of environments that are used to play those games.
Slate and UMG are very inefficient for UI because they re-render as fast as my computer and framerate limit will let it.
With just a Blueprint open and nothing else, my iGPU usage spikes up and stays very high, even if there is no motion,
until I tab out.
As a result, my battery drains extremely fast whenever using Blueprint in comparison to Visual Studio, VSCode, any
JetBrains IDEs, etc.

Note that I didn't even mention Blueprint's performance itself.
While, relatively speaking, it is very slow and just about every language you can think of is faster in raw performance,
it is typically fast enough for most things you'd work on.
Generally, the problem with Blueprint is that the UX is abysmal whenever using a laptop,
and using C++ is far more pleasant whenever working with a laptop.
However, the compilation times are very long with C++ and there are many times when the hot-reload just doesn't work.
And since UE C++'s engine types are held back by what is possible in Blueprint,
there are many things you can't do if you're trying to have managed lifetimes.
Unreal Verse is supposed to be Epic's answer to all of these problems
and is available to preview in the Unreal Editor for Fortnite, but it's not available for UE until Unreal Engine 6.
For scripting languages, are there any options?

Yes, there are.

# Goal

I am wanting to try out different programming languages in Unreal Engine and evaluate the pros and cons to using them.
The goal is to find the best alternative language to use for Unreal Engine while waiting out for Unreal Verse to be
added as an official option in Unreal Engine 6.
The options here are ordered by language and ranked by viability for run-time programming,
like an `order by language, rank asc`.

## C++

> One of the key moments in Unreal Engine 4's development was,
> we had a series of debates about UnrealScript â€“ the scripting language I'd built that we'd carried through three
> generations.
> And what we needed to do to make it competitive in the future. And we kept going through bigger and bigger feature
> lists of what we needed to do to upgrade it,
> and who could possibly do the work, and it was getting really, really unwieldy.
> And there was this massive meeting to try and sort it out, and try to cut things and decide what to keep,
> and plan and...there was this point where I looked at that and said 'you know, everything you're proposing to add to
> UnrealScript is already in C++.
> Why don't we just kill UnrealScript and move to pure C++? You know, maximum performance and maximum debuggability. It
> gives us all these advantages.'

- Pros
    - Fast runtime performance
    - Allows for integration with any C++ library given you can make a wrapper around it that plays nicely with Unreal
    - First-class support within Unreal Engine
- Cons
    - Very slow compilation times
    - Template params do not work with Unreal Engine's reflection system
        - This includes all template types and template functions except for `TMap`, `TSet`, and `TArray`
    - Unreal Engine is very particular about its reflection macros and will throw oftentimes unintelligible errors
      whenever a reflection macro isn't applied correctly
    - Hot-reload only really works consistently whenever updating function logic; attempting to update signatures of any
      kind often will require a restart to work as expected

## Blueprint

When Epic Games transitioned from UE3 to UE4, they opted to drop their custom scripting language, Unreal Script,
in favor of going all-in on their visual scripting language, Kismet (which was renamed to Blueprint) coupled with C++.
With that, if you ever see a "K" prefix in front of anything in C++, it is very likely a prefix for "Kismet."
For example, K2_Nodes; "K2" means Kismet 2.x

- Pros
    - Best runtime performance
    - Extremely fast compile times
    - Compilations work very consistently; no need to restart for any structural changes
    - Beginner-friendly; great gateway drug into learning other languages
    - *Can be* simpler to follow the flow for
        - On the other hand, can get far more complex than regular code to follow as you write more sophisticated code
    - Very tight integration with the editor. Gives you type-safety for editor-time things not exposed to C++ like
      objects contained in a level
    - Simple support for Generic/Template logic/functions through Macros or custom K2_Nodes
- Cons
    - No native `any` or `void*` type, but it's pretty straightforward to make a thin wrapper around `FVariant`,
      `FInstancedStruct`, and `TVariant` in C++ to do the same
        - See something like [AnyValue](https://www.fab.com/listings/242b2e28-db6b-4e69-9744-067b4e171a0f) for that as a
          paid plugin, or [this](https://github.com/CromwellTech/BpValueBox) as a FOSS plugin.
          I chose against this approach for making my plugin because constantly needing to cast to-and-from was getting
          to make for a terrible developer experience
    - Functions are NOT first-class citizens
    - Blueprints are completely stored in binary, which makes diffing for merging or reviewing code extremely difficult
    - Slow runtime performance
        - But this should NOT be a problem for the majority of use cases
    - Can only do what is exposed to do in Blueprint, which can be very limited depending on your use case

## AngelScript

### [AngelScript](https://angelscript.hazelight.se/)

- Pros
    - Actively maintained by Hazelight
      - Used in *It Takes Two*, *Split Fiction*, *The Finals*, and *ARC Raiders*
    - Supported on all platforms
    - Rapid compile times
    - Fast runtime performance, not far off from C++
    - Has access to all functions and types exposed to Blueprint
    - Can be used at runtime
    - Can be used to expose functions and types to Blueprint
    - Supports Mixin functions, akin to extension methods in C#
- Cons
    - Requires using a fork of Unreal Engine, which makes using plugins more difficult
    - Doesn't support interfaces
        - I hope that this changes because this is a pretty big limitation
    - Doesn't support generics/templates outside of `TMap`, `TSet`, and `TArray`

## [SkookumScript](https://skookumscript.com/unreal/)

Was originally a very well-maintained and performant alternative scripting language which ended up getting bought by
Epic Games and became Verse

## [Verse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verse_(programming_language))

- Only available in Unreal Editor for Fortnite right now
- Won't be available in Unreal Engine until Unreal Engine 6

- Pros
    - Supports proper custom generic/template types
    - Support interfaces
- Cons
    - Still unstable
    - Extremely different programming paradigm than Blueprint; could make plugin development more difficult,
      but that is speculative

## Python

### [UnrealEnginePython](https://github.com/20tab/UnrealEnginePython)

This project hasn't been updated since 2020-04-17.
Unfortunately, the project was abandoned because Epic Games made their own implementation of Python for Unreal Engine.
The nifty part about this project was that it was able to be used at runtime

### Python (Official)

Unfortunately, this is editor only. Runtime builds completely strip all the Python out of it.
Maybe it'd be possible to create a fork of the Unreal Engine source code which doesn't strip this out?
Regardless, this is particularly useful for making editor tools and doing editor automation,
but it is limited to what is exposed to it through Unreal Engine's reflection system.
But it is still useful for making editor tools since you can use the full power of Python.

### [Nitro Python Runtime (Python)](https://www.fab.com/listings/fb18f1b0-3977-4cd7-b24e-ae7f8355e559)

Only for calling Python scripts. Can push and pull variable names + values from/to the executed script but cannot
directly access UE5 internals

### [Yothon (Python)](https://www.yobiminds.com/yothon.html) and https://www.fab.com/listings/8d83689b-941a-49d9-ae22-f982d2d7e498

> Please note that, at this stage, Python scripts cannot directly access UE5 internals, e.g. UObjects.

As a result, this doesn't seem too different from just executing a Python command and dynamically passing in or pulling
those values as a JSON

## .NET

One fun benefit to using .NET is that with something like Jint or IronPython,
you can actually write your logic in JavaScript or Python.

### [UnrealSharp (.NET 9+)](https://www.unrealsharp.com/)

TODO

- Pros
- Cons
  - Currently only supports Windows and Mac
